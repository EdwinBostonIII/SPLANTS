# SPLANTS Marketing Engine - Configuration File
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# ============================================
#
# IMPORTANT: After creating .env, restart the system:
#   docker-compose restart app
#
# For detailed setup instructions, see:
#   - README.md - Complete documentation
#   - SETUP_GUIDE.md - Visual step-by-step guide
#   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Problem solving
#
# ============================================

# ============================================
# REQUIRED - Core Configuration
# These settings MUST be configured for the system to work
# ============================================

# OpenAI API Key
# --------------
# What: Your personal key to access OpenAI's GPT-4 AI
# Where to get: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Cost: ~$0.03 per piece of content generated
# Format: Starts with "sk-" or "sk-proj-"
# Example: sk-proj-AbCdEf123456...
# SECURITY: Keep this secret! Don't share or commit to git
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# System API Key (Your Security Password)
# ----------------------------------------
# What: Password that protects YOUR SPLANTS system from unauthorized use
# Purpose: Only people with this key can generate content through your system
# Requirements: 
#   - At least 12 characters
#   - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
#   - Don't use common words
# Examples:
#   - Business!Marketing#2024
#   - MySecure!Content789
#   - SmallBiz$AI@2024
# SECURITY: Change from default! Keep this secret!
API_KEY=change-this-to-a-secure-password-123

# Database Connection URL
# -----------------------
# What: Connection string for PostgreSQL database
# Purpose: Stores all your generated content, analytics, and settings
# DEFAULT: Leave as-is if using Docker Compose (recommended)
# ONLY CHANGE if deploying to external database
# Format: postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://splants:password@db:5432/splants

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL - Cost Control (HIGHLY Recommended!)
# Protect yourself from unexpected charges
# ============================================

# Monthly AI Spending Limit (in US Dollars)
# ------------------------------------------
# What: Maximum amount to spend on AI content generation per month
# How it works: 
#   - System tracks all OpenAI API costs
#   - Stops generating content when limit is reached
#   - Resets on 1st of each month
# Special values:
#   - 0 = UNLIMITED (not recommended! You could accidentally spend a lot)
#   - Any number = Hard limit in dollars
# Recommended settings:
#   - Light use (50-100 pieces/month): 30
#   - Medium use (200-300 pieces/month): 50
#   - Heavy use (500+ pieces/month): 100
# Example: If you set 50, and you've spent $49.50, the next request will be blocked
MONTHLY_AI_BUDGET=50

# Daily API Request Limit
# -----------------------
# What: Maximum number of content generation requests per day
# Purpose: Prevents accidental overuse (e.g., if you have a bug in your code)
# How it works:
#   - Counts every call to /v1/generate
#   - Resets at midnight UTC
#   - Blocks requests once limit is reached
# Special values:
#   - 0 = UNLIMITED (not recommended)
#   - Any number = Hard limit per day
# Recommended settings:
#   - Light use: 25-50
#   - Normal use: 100
#   - Heavy use: 500
# Example: If you set 100, you can generate max 100 pieces per day
DAILY_API_LIMIT=100

# ============================================
# OPTIONAL - Content Generation Settings
# Control the size and defaults for generated content
# ============================================

# Maximum Content Length (in words)
# ----------------------------------
# What: Absolute maximum words per content generation
# Purpose: Prevents accidentally generating huge content (which costs more)
# Valid range: 50 to 10,000 words
# Impact on cost: Longer content = higher cost
# Recommended: 2000 (allows blog posts but not books)
# Cost comparison:
#   - 500 words: ~$0.02
#   - 1000 words: ~$0.03
#   - 2000 words: ~$0.05
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=2000

# Default Content Length (in words)
# ----------------------------------
# What: Default word count if user doesn't specify length
# Purpose: Provides sensible default for quick content generation
# Valid range: 50 to MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
# Recommended by type:
#   - Social media: 100-200
#   - Email: 300-500
#   - Blog posts: 500-800
#   - Long-form: 1000-1500
# Note: Users can override this in their requests
DEFAULT_CONTENT_LENGTH=500

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# What: API key for Anthropic's Claude AI (alternative to GPT-4)
# Where to get: https://anthropic.com/api
# Purpose: Enables "Multi-Model Synthesis" premium feature
# How it works:
#   - Generates content with BOTH GPT-4 and Claude
#   - Combines best elements from both
#   - Results in 20-30% higher quality scores
# Cost: +$0.02 to $0.05 per request (on top of normal cost)
# When to use:
#   - Important content (landing pages, key blog posts)
#   - When quality is more important than cost
#   - Client work where you need maximum quality
# To enable: Uncomment line below and add your key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Redis Cache URL (OPTIONAL - For Cost Reduction)
# ------------------------------------------------
# What: Connection string for Redis cache server
# Purpose: Caches frequently requested content to reduce AI API costs
# Benefits:
#   - Reduces costs by 30-50%
#   - Faster responses for similar requests
#   - Lower load on OpenAI API
# Cost: +$10-15/month for Redis hosting
# ROI: Pays for itself if you generate >300 pieces/month
# Setup:
#   1. Uncomment Redis service in docker-compose.yml
#   2. Uncomment the line below
