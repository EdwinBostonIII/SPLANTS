# PART 1: THE "WHAT & WHY"

## What You're Actually Building {#what-youre-building}

You're building a **complete automated business** that runs itself. Let's be crystal clear about what that means:

### The Business Model

**Product**: Custom paint-splattered sweatpants (joggers)
- Each pair is unique (no two are the same)
- Sell price: $89.99
- Your cost: ~$47 (Printful manufacturing + shipping)
- Your profit: ~$40 per pair

**The Automation**:
1. Customer clicks "Buy Now" on your website/link
2. Stripe processes payment automatically
3. Make.com receives notification and springs into action
4. OpenAI generates unique product description
5. DALL-E creates custom mockup image
6. Printful receives manufacturing order
7. Customer gets beautiful confirmation email
8. Airtable logs everything
9. Slack notifies you (optional)
10. **Your involvement: ZERO minutes**

**For Your Automated System**:
