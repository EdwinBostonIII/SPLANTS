3. **Leverage SPLANTS Efficiency**

   - A/B test to find effective approaches (data-driven decisions)

#### When to Increase Investment

Now you will set up your SPLANTS Marketing Engine. This section provides streamlined instructions for installing the system on your computer.

### Time Requirements

- **Reading and Planning:** 15 minutes

- **SPLANTS Download and Setup:** 10 minutes
- **Configuration and Testing:** 15-30 minutes
- **Total:** 1-2 hours (mostly waiting for downloads)

### What You're Installing

You're setting up 3 components that work together:

```
YOUR COMPUTER
  |
  |-- Docker (Container Platform)
       |
       |-- SPLANTS Marketing Engine
            |-- Database (PostgreSQL)
            |-- API Server (FastAPI)
            |-- Web UI (React)
  |
  v
Internet Connection
  |
  v
OpenAI GPT-4 API
```

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Install Docker (The Foundation)

Docker is a platform that contains all the software SPLANTS needs. You install Docker once.

##### For Windows Users (10/11)

1. **Check Windows Version:**
   - Press `Windows + R`
   - Type `winver` and press Enter
   - Requirement: Windows 10/11 64-bit (Build 19041+)

2. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Navigate to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - File size: approximately 500MB (download time 5-15 minutes)

3. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   ```
   - Double-click Docker Desktop Installer.exe
   - Click "Yes" when Windows requests permission
   - Use default settings (check "Use WSL 2" if prompted)
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
   - Click "Close and restart" when finished
   ```

4. **Verify Docker is Running:**
   - After restart, look for whale icon in system tray (bottom-right)
   - Icon presence indicates Docker is running

**Troubleshooting Windows:**
- If Docker won't start: Enable "Virtualization" in BIOS settings
- If "WSL 2" error appears: Run `wsl --install` in PowerShell (as Administrator)
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#docker-wont-start-on-windows) for detailed help

##### For macOS Users

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Navigate to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Choose appropriate version: "Mac with Intel chip" OR "Mac with Apple chip (M1/M2/M3)"
   - File size: approximately 400-600MB

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   ```
   - Open the downloaded .dmg file
   - Drag Docker icon to Applications folder
   - Open Docker from Applications
   - Enter your Mac password when prompted
   - Click "Open" if security warning appears
   ```

3. **Verify Docker is Running:**
   - Look for whale icon in menu bar (top-right)
   - Icon presence indicates Docker is running

##### For Linux Users (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. **Open Terminal** (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`)

2. **Run Installation Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Download Docker installation script
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   
   # Run the installation script
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   
   # Add your user to docker group (eliminates need for sudo)
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   
   # Install Docker Compose
   sudo apt install docker-compose -y
   ```

3. **Restart Your Computer**

4. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   # Should display: Docker version 24.x.x or newer
   
   docker-compose --version
   # Should display: docker-compose version 1.x.x or newer
   ```

#### Step 2: Get Your OpenAI API Key

OpenAI provides the AI (GPT-4) that creates your marketing content. The API key functions like a password allowing SPLANTS to use OpenAI's AI.

1. **Create Account (if you haven't already):**
   - Navigate to: https://platform.openai.com/signup
   - Sign up with email or Google account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Add Billing Information:**
   - Navigate to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
   - Click "Add payment method"
   - Add credit/debit card
   - Load $20 credit (generates approximately 600-700 pieces of content)

   **Recommendation:** Set a spending limit in OpenAI billing settings:
   - Navigate to "Usage limits"
   - Set "Hard limit" to $50/month
   - This prevents unexpected charges

3. **Create API Key:**
   - Navigate to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Give it a name: "SPLANTS Marketing Engine"
   - **Important:** Copy the key immediately
   - Key starts with `sk-proj-` and is quite long
   - Store it securely (you cannot view it again)

   **Example API Key Format:**
   ```
   sk-proj-abc123XYZ...45characters...more...
   ```

   **Security Warning:** Never share this key or commit it to public repositories.

#### Step 3: Download SPLANTS Marketing Engine

Now you'll get the SPLANTS software onto your computer.

**Option A: Using Git (Recommended)**

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed):
   - **Windows:** Download from https://git-scm.com
   - **Mac:** Open Terminal, type `git --version` (installs automatically)
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt install git`

2. **Download SPLANTS:**
   ```bash
   # Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)
   
   # Navigate to desired installation location (e.g., Desktop)
   cd Desktop
   
   # Download SPLANTS
   git clone https://github.com/EdwinBostonIII/SPLANTS.git
   
   # Enter the SPLANTS directory
   cd SPLANTS
   ```

**Option B: Download ZIP (Simpler for Beginners)**

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/EdwinBostonIII/SPLANTS
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Save to your Desktop
5. Extract the ZIP file
6. Rename extracted folder to `SPLANTS` (if needed)
7. Open Terminal/Command Prompt in that folder:
   - **Windows:** Right-click folder, select "Open in Terminal"
   - **Mac:** Right-click folder, Services, "New Terminal at Folder"
   - **Linux:** Right-click folder, "Open in Terminal"

#### Step 4: Verify Prerequisites

Before continuing, verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check Docker
docker --version
# Expected: Docker version 24.x.x or newer

# Check Docker Compose
docker-compose --version
# OR (on newer Docker versions)
docker compose version
# Expected: version 1.x.x or 2.x.x

# Confirm you're in SPLANTS directory
pwd
# Should show path ending in /SPLANTS

# List files to verify
ls
# Should show: main.py, docker-compose.yml, README.md, etc.
```

**All checks passed?** Proceed to next section.  
**Something failed?** See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#installation-problems) for assistance.
