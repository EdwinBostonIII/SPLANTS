##  Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Install Docker (The "Container" for the Software)

Docker is a tool that runs the software in an isolated environment. You only need to install it once.

#### For Windows:

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docker.com/get-started](https://docker.com/get-started)
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - File size: ~500MB (may take 5-10 minutes to download)

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Double-click the downloaded file
   - Follow the installation wizard (click "Next" → "Next" → "Install")
   - Restart your computer when prompted

3. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Look for a whale icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
   - If you see it, Docker is running! 

**Troubleshooting:** If Docker doesn't start, you may need to enable virtualization in your BIOS. [See detailed guide here](#troubleshooting-docker-wont-start-on-windows)

#### For Mac:

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to [docker.com/get-started](https://docker.com/get-started)
   - Click "Download for Mac"
   - Choose "Mac with Intel chip" or "Mac with Apple chip" (M1/M2)

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
   - Drag Docker to your Applications folder
   - Open Docker from Applications

3. **Verify It's Working:**
   - Look for a whale icon in your menu bar (top-right)
   - If you see it, Docker is running! 

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. **Open Terminal** (Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`)

2. **Run These Commands** (copy and paste one at a time):

```bash
# Download Docker installation script
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

# Run the installation script
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add your user to the docker group (so you don't need sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

3. **Restart Your Computer**

4. **Verify It's Working:**
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like "Docker version 24.0.6"

---

### Step 2: Get Your OpenAI API Key

OpenAI is the company that provides the AI (GPT-4) that creates your content.

**Think of the API key like a password** that lets this program use OpenAI's AI.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Create an OpenAI Account:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Sign up with your email
   - Verify your email address

2. **Add Billing Information:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
   - Click "Add payment method"
   - Add a credit card
   - **Add $20 credit** (this will generate ~600-700 pieces of content)

3. **Create an API Key:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the key immediately! It starts with `sk-`
   - Save it in a safe place (you can't see it again)

**Example API Key:** `sk-proj-abc123XYZ...` (yours will be longer)

** Pro Tip:** Set up a spending limit in OpenAI's billing settings to prevent unexpected charges.

##  Verify Your Installation

After setup, verify everything is working correctly.

### Quick Verification

The system includes automated verification scripts:

#### Option 1: Pre-Installation System Check

Before installing, verify your system meets all requirements:

```bash
./scripts_check-system.sh
```

This checks:
- ✅ Operating system compatibility
- ✅ Docker installation and version
- ✅ Docker Compose availability
- ✅ System resources (RAM, disk space)
- ✅ Network connectivity
- ✅ Required ports availability

#### Option 2: Post-Installation Verification

After setup, verify the installation is working:

```bash
./scripts_verify-installation.sh
```

This validates:
- ✅ Configuration file exists and is valid
- ✅ Docker containers are running
- ✅ Services are healthy (database, API, web UI)
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Database connection works
- ✅ No errors in recent logs

Both scripts provide clear pass/fail feedback and actionable remediation steps.

### Manual Verification

If you prefer to verify manually:

1. **Check services are running:**
   ```bash
   make status
   ```

2. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Access the web interface:**
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

---

### Manual Setup (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to configure manually or the wizard doesn't work:

1. **Create Your Configuration File**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file** and add:
   - Your OpenAI API key (from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - A secure system API key (at least 12 characters)
   - Your monthly budget (optional, recommended: $50)

3. **Start the system:**

   ```bash
   make start
   ```
   
   Or directly with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d   # Modern Docker Desktop (v2.x)
   # OR
   docker-compose up -d   # Older standalone version
   ```

---

##  Managing the System

The Makefile provides simple commands for all operations:

### Essential Commands

```bash
make start     # First-time setup and start (runs interactive wizard)
make stop      # Stop all services
make restart   # Restart all services
make logs      # View application logs (live)
make status    # Check service status
make test      # Run API tests to verify everything works
```

### Maintenance Commands

```bash
make backup              # Backup database
make restore file=<file> # Restore database from backup
make update              # Pull latest changes and rebuild
make clean               # Remove all data (WARNING: deletes everything!)
```

### Development Commands

```bash
make dev       # Start in development mode (with logs)
make build     # Build Docker images
make rebuild   # Rebuild Docker images (no cache)
make monitor   # Monitor resource usage
```

### Troubleshooting

If something isn't working:

1. **Run the test suite:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
   
   This validates the API contract between backend and frontend. If tests pass, the problem is likely in the frontend. If they fail, it's in the backend.

2. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   make logs
   ```

3. **Verify services are running:**
   ```bash
   make status
   ```

   - The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` for protection
   - Use different API keys for development and production

2. **System API Key:**
   - Generate a strong, unique API key (minimum 32 characters)
   - Use a password manager to store it securely
   - Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)

3. **OpenAI API Key Security:**
   - Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard
   - Monitor API usage regularly
   - Revoke and regenerate keys if compromised
   - Never share keys in screenshots, logs, or error messages

4. **Access Control:**
   - Limit who has access to the server/machine running SPLANTS
   - Use firewalls to restrict network access to trusted IPs
   - Consider using SSH key authentication for remote servers
   - Enable audit logging for production environments

5. **Docker Security:**
   - Keep Docker and all images updated
   - Don't expose unnecessary ports publicly
   - Use Docker secrets for sensitive data in production
   - Run containers with minimal privileges

6. **Database Security:**
   - Change default PostgreSQL password in production
   - Use strong database passwords (20+ characters)
   - Restrict database access to localhost only (unless needed)
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production

7. **Production Deployment:**
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all web traffic
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity
   - Regular security updates and patches

**Emergency Response:**
If you believe your API keys have been compromised:
1. Immediately revoke the compromised keys
2. Generate new keys
3. Update your `.env` file
4. Restart the system: `make restart`
5. Monitor OpenAI billing for unauthorized usage

- Backups: Manual creation/deletion (you control retention)

**Manual Data Management:**

1. **Backup Content:**
   ```bash
   make backup
   ```
   Creates timestamped backup in `backups/` folder

2. **Export Specific Content:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U splants splants -t contents > my-contents.sql
   ```

3. **Delete Old Content:**
   Access the database and delete by date:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db psql -U splants -d splants -c "DELETE FROM contents WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';"
   ```

4. **Complete Data Deletion:**
   ```bash
   make clean  # WARNING: Deletes ALL data permanently
   ```

### GDPR Compliance

If you're subject to GDPR or handling EU user data:

1. **Data Subject Requests:**
   - Export: Use database export commands above
   - Delete: Use SQL commands to remove specific records
   - Audit: All operations logged in application logs

2. **Right to be Forgotten:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db psql -U splants -d splants -c "DELETE FROM contents WHERE metadata->>'user_id' = 'USER_ID';"
   ```

3. **Data Processing Agreement:**
   - Review OpenAI's [DPA](https://openai.com/policies/data-processing-addendum)
   - Review Anthropic's privacy terms if using premium mode

4. **Recommended Retention Policy:**
   - Production content: 2 years
   - Test content: 90 days
   - Analytics data: 1 year
   - Logs: 30 days

### Backup Strategy

**Recommended Backup Schedule:**
- **Daily:** Automated database backup (use cron jobs)
- **Weekly:** Full system backup (database + configuration)
- **Monthly:** Archive backup to external storage

**Example Cron Job for Daily Backups:**
```bash
# Add to crontab: crontab -e
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/SPLANTS && make backup
```

**Backup Verification:**
```bash
# Test restore on a copy
docker-compose down
make restore file=backups/latest-backup.sql.gz
make test  # Verify system works
```
